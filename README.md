# React Portfolio

## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Description
Allows employers to view a few of my most recent projects and resume.  There's also a homepage that tells the employer a little bit about me as well as a contact page where they can get into contact with me. 

## Deployed Link
